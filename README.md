## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but Alamofire does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/DoubleNode/DNSNetwork.git", from: "1.8.0")
]
```

## Dependencies

-   Alamofire v5.4.4+
-   AlamofireImage v4.2.0+
-   AtomicSwift v1.2.2+
-   DNSAppCore v1.8.0+
-   DNSBaseTheme v1.8.0+
-   DNSCore v1.8.0+
-   DNSCoreThreading v1.8.0+
-   Hippolyte v1.4.0+
